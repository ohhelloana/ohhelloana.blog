A couple of jobs ago, I was in the common area having lunch when a work colleague asked me if I had a Twitter account. “Yes”, I replied and told him what was my Twitter handle. I saw him scrolling on his phone and, after a minute, he looked at me and said: “wow, you don’t post anything about tech” while frowning their face as if I had just ruined Christmas. I don’t remember if I replied but I do remember, a few minutes later, checking my phone and noticing he didn’t follow me. That was awkward. 

I felt embarrassed and judged and it was an interaction that I never forgot. I’ve had my share of accidental *faux pas* and, especially in the last two years, I’ve been struggling with social anxiety but that was a new experience to me. I internalised that interaction so hard that, six years after, it still bothers me and makes me judge my own social media.

Realistically, I understand that my feed (and me as a person) will not please everybody but this wasn’t really a stranger. This was someone who worked closely with me and, unsolicitedly, judged me and rejected me.

The unsolicited rejection was a frequent thing growing up as a woman but lately, it has taken a new form as I became a bit more active in the tech community. 

Recently, I received a Twitter notification saying that I was tagged in a tweet. A wonderful friend of mine replied to someone who was asking recommendations for blog articles and the person asking was someone with quite a big following and, I suppose, popularity. 

I was truly flattered that my friend thought of me, of all people, and I got a little bit excited at the idea that someone who is respected in the community could read what I wrote and appreciate it. 

But nothing happened. Not even a “like” from the original poster. I felt embarrassed. Heck, I felt embarrassed that I noticed that it didn’t even get a “like”. I thought I was cooler than that. I wondered what happened. Did they click my blog post and thought “what a load of crap”? I felt a new flavour of shame that I wasn’t unfamiliar with but until that point, I couldn’t really explain it.

This happened before when I was tagged in tweets that ask people to suggest “women in tech” to follow. Not that I am tagged frequently (at all), but the few times that I am, that has never resulted in a new follower. Ever. Did the original poster see my profile and thought “wow she sucks”? 

When these types of tweets came out, I was flattered that someone thought of me and maybe because I would be tagged, without a lot of context alongside a lot of other women, I didn’t take it too personally. But the mental note still existed: someone rejected me when I didn’t even ask for it.

I understand now that the majority of those tweets are clout chasers. They are written by, usually, men, who want to do some performative work to pretend they care about diversifying their timeline. By having a popular tweet, and because a lot of people interacted with it in good faith, the social media algorithm works in their favour to promote their own account while also getting “ally” points. I’m sure they mute their own tweet immediately after posting it. 

The last example might have an explanation but the rejection is still there. When my inner critic is on and ready to hurt me, I imagine that other people scroll through those tweets and make a deliberate decision that I am not worthy of. Almost like we would be in a group and somebody introduces me and nobody acknowledges what just happened (which has happened in life real and it sucks).

There’s no resentment or bitterness here. Just the acknowledgement that it is an unpleasant feeling to sit with. That this unsolicited rejection sometimes sucks a bit.
